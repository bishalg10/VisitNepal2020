	<h2 style="text-align:center;color:#4a4c8f;">Holy Indigeneous</h2>
	<p>The temple of Pashupatinath is the richest and holiest 
	Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is merely 6 km east
	of Kathmandu and a center of annual pilgrimage on the day of 
	Maha Shivaratri which falls in the month of February/March. This 
	temple is situated amidst a lush green natural setting on the bank
	of the sacred Bagmati River.<br>

	The temple in Pagoda style has gold gilted two tier roof and richly
	carved silver doors which are famous for the superb architecture.
	The premise of this temple is accessible only to hindus. Visitors
	and non-hindus are permitted to view the temple only from the east
	bank of River Bagmati.<br><br>

	Hindus arrive here to find shelter for the last several weeks of their
	lives, to meet death, be cremated on the banks of the river and travel 
	their last journey with the waters of the sacred river Bagmati, which
	later meets the holy river Ganges. Hinduists from every corner of Nepal 
	and India are arriving here to die.</p>

		<p>You will come across stories of Gods and Goddesses as you walk the streets 
		and alleys of Nepal. Where each day is a celebration of life, there are numerous
		festivals throughout the year. The sounds of drums and cymbals, the flute players, 
		the masked dancers and the quiet hum of sacred chants permeate the air in processions 
		and parades that celebrate the culture and heritage of the nation.<br><br>

		Nepal is home to the living Goddess, the Kumari – a manifestation of female divinity, 
		who is venerated and worshiped by devotees across the country.</p>
